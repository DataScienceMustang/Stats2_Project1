#Column definitions:
Adult.mortality: Adult Mortality Rates of both sexes (probability of dying between 15 and 60 years per 1000 population)
Infant.death: Number of Infant Deaths per 1000 population
Alcohol: Alcohol, recorded per capita (15+) consumption (in litres of pure alcohol)
percentage expenditure: Expenditure on health as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product per capita(%)
Hepatitis B: Hepatitis B (HepB) immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%)
Measles - number of reported cases per 1000 population
BMI: Average Body Mass Index of entire population
Under-five-deaths: Number of under-five deaths per 1000 population
Polio: Polio (Pol3) immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%)
Total expenditure: General government expenditure on health as a percentage of total government expenditure (%)
Diphtheria: Diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP3) immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%)
HIV/AIDS: Deaths per 1 000 live births HIV/AIDS (0-4 years)
GDP: Gross Domestic Product per capita (in USD)
Population: Population of the country
thinness: Prevalence of thinness among children and adolescents for Age 10 to 19 (% )
Thinness 5-9: Prevalence of thinness among children for Age 5 to 9(%)
income composition: Human Development Index in terms of income composition of resources (index ranging from 0 to 1)
Schooling: Number of years of Schooling(years)


##Things to note from summary stats:
 * 83% of data comes from developing countries, life exp may be lower.
 * Mean life expectancy is 71.54 yr old
 * The max for Measles seems outrageously high 79k - which country? outlier?
 * Looks like there's a couple of positive correlations with life expectancy: income.compostion & schooling
 * Adult mortality seems to have a gender split, but cannot determine for certain
 * No outward evidence of any of the parameters having a non-linear relationship (adding a quadratic)

#Visualizing some of the data

Boxplot of life expectancy by country status:
```{r}
df.2014 %>% ggplot(aes(y = Life.expectancy)) + geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~Status)
```

Pairwise plots for selected variables:
```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
df2 <- select(df.2014, c(Life.expectancy, Adult.Mortality, Total.expenditure, HIV.AIDS, Income.composition.of.resources, Schooling))
library(GGally)
ggpairs(df2)
```

Correlation between life expectancy and all the numeric independent variables:
```{r}
cor.xy <- cor(df.2014 %>% select(-c(Country, Year, Status)), use = "complete.obs")
LE.cor <- data.frame(var = rownames(cor.xy)[-1], correlation = cor.xy[-1, 1])
LE.cor %>% ggplot(aes(x = var, y = correlation)) + geom_col() + coord_flip()
```

# Checking correlations between variables that are missing data and variables I think may make good substitutes and are not missing data.
It seems that Schooling is a good replacement for income.comp though it seems as though income.comp has a slightly better relationship with life expectancy
I think Im going to go with Schooling as the more complete variable
Diphtheria and HepB also seem like good substitutes and diptheria is the more highly correlated with life expectancy going to throw out income.comp, and HepB, along with year, country, status to check correlations in next chunk.
